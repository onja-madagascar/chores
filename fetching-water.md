**How often:** 2 times a day before class, and before accent training after lunch.

**Tools**

- Buckets
- Rope
- The well
Someone to help you
250l water drums
- Water purifier bottle

**The process**

Before you start, make sure to:
- Attach the rope to the bucket

OK, now you’re ready to go:

1. Drop the bucket into the well, while holding onto the rope.     
1. Pull the bucket up and pour the water into the big drum.
1. And repeat the process until the drum is full
1. If you’ve filled the drums by the well, please use 12 capfuls of water purifier per drum
1. If you’ve filled the drums by the kitchen, you won’t need water purifier, we use that water for cooking.

**Who to call for help?**
