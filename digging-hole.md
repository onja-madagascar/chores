# Digging hole
**How often**:one time every two months

## Tools
- Three spades 
- Three empty sacks 
 - A place where we can dig a hole
 ## The process
- Find the place where we can dig the hole
- Decide the shape of the hole
- Make sure that we agree on how long the hole should be
- Dig the hole
- Throw the mud next to the hole in case we'll need it when the hole is full
## Someone to help
- We need four boys so that we can get the hole finished on time
