# Digging hole
**How often**:once every two months

## Tools
- Three spades 
- Three empty sacks 
 - A place where we can dig a hole
 ## The process
- Find a place where we can dig the hole
- Decide the shape of the hole
- Make sure that we agree on how long the ole should be
- Dig the hole
- Throw the mud next to the hole in case we'll need it when the hole is full
## Someone to help
- We need four boys so that we can get the work done on time
